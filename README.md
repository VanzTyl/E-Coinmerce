# TIP QC Project #1 E-Coinmerce (Developer: VanzTyl)

### When : 1st Year | 1st Sem
### For : Intro to Computing (2024 - 2025)
### What : Educational Mockup Crypto Trading Platform

---
In this project I'll be creating a mockup platform using random generated prices for 30 coins that simulates a realtime market simulation wherein the user will be able to create positions in the market and experience real-time trading without using their own money.

E-Coinmerce has its own personal coins created personally by the team.
